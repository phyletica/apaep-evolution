    Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the
    most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light it becomes a pile
    of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious but making no
    meaningful picture as a whole.

    of evolution. The American Biology Teacher 35:125--129.

    \section{Our goal}
    
    \noindent\textbf{Welcome to Evolutionary Biology!}
    In this class, we will explore the most important concept in biology---the
    theory that unifies all the life sciences.
    Throughout the course, we will seek to better understand the nature of
    science, in general, by practicing scientific thinking.
    Specifically, we will study the processes that cause the characteristics of
    populations to change over time.
    Once we become comfortable with these processes, we will start to see how
    they offer an elegant explanation for the amazing diversity of life on our
    planet,
    and make predictions relevant to our own health.
