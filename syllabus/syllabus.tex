    Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the
    most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light it becomes a pile
    of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious but making no
    meaningful picture as a whole.

    of evolution. The American Biology Teacher 35:125--129.

    \section{Our goal}
    
    \noindent\textbf{Welcome to Evolutionary Biology!}
    In this class, we will explore the most important concept in biology---the
    theory that unifies all the life sciences.
    Throughout the course, we will seek to better understand the nature of
    science, in general, by practicing scientific thinking.
    Specifically, we will study the processes that cause the characteristics of
    populations to change over time.
    Once we become comfortable with these processes, we will start to see how
    they offer an elegant explanation for the amazing diversity of life on our
    planet,
    and make predictions relevant to our own health.

\section{Course Outcomes}
\begin{description}
    \item [Certificate of Completion.]
        In order to receive this certificate, you must attend 70\% of all
        classes (8/12).
    \item [Continuing Education Units.]
        You must attend all classes and complete all assigned work in order to
        receive CEU from Auburn University. We do allow for 1 absence. We can't
        make any exceptions to this policy.
\end{description}

\section{A Note on Classroom Respect}
Side conversations are a problem. These are distracting and make for
ineffective class time. In a room the size of our classroom at Staton Annex,
side conversations will not be tolerated. Keep asides and commentary to a
minimum, or none at all. I shouldn't have to remind you of this. Please be
respectful of discussion space and allow everyone room to talk. Do not be
discouraging toward yourself or your peers. Please utilize your class breaks
for personal conversations. Please do not eat in the classroom. You will be
provided class breaks and a lunch break for these purposes.

\section{PREA}
I have undergone PREA Training with an ADOC representative and understand the
protocol and my obligations as a first responder, were an incident to occur
during my tenure with APAEP/AU. If someone reports something to me, I will
follow the necessary procedure to report the incident to the person in charge.

Please understand that in addition to the stipulations of PREA, I am also under
obligation to report any concern that a student may harm himself or others. 

\section{Social Media Statement}
As a representative of APAEP/AU I have also undergone thorough training with
APAEP administrators. If you should need to be in contact with me outside of
classroom and office hours, please direct that communication to the APAEP
office by mail, or speak with an APAEP Administrator in person. \textbf{DO NOT}
contact me via social media. If a student should happen to contact me via a
channel of communication that is not approved by APAEP/ADOC, I will immediately
report the incident to APAEP Administration and action will be taken. Please
understand that this communication stipulation also extends beyond the bounds
of the semester. I ask that, if you should wish to contact me after my tenure
with the program, you direct that to the APAEP office, who will then notify me.

\section{Letters of Recommendation}
All letters for parole consideration and recommendation must come from the
APAEP Program Director. Please do not ask me to write a letter or
recommendation on your behalf. Direct all inquiries via mail to Kyes
Stevens/APAEP Administration.
