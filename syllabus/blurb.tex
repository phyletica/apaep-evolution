Biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky said that ``nothing in biology makes sense
except in the light of evolution.''
In this class, we will gain an appreciation for how the theory of evolution
provides a unifying framework for everything that we know about life on our
planet.
Through a combination of reading, discussion, and activities, we will become
familiar with the processes that cause the characteristics of populations to
change over time.
With this familiarity, we will gain an understanding of how these processes
provide an elegant explanation for the amazing diversity of life on Earth.
