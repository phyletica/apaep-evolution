After finishing slides on mitosis and meiosis:

What is the process/mechanism responible for Mendel's laws?

Answer: Genes are on chromosomes that undergo meiosis

1.  We drew meiosis with 2n = 4 with Pp on one pair of homologs, and Tt on the
    other

    -   This will give us the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio

2.  If these two genes were close to each other on the same chromosome,
    we would see the 3 purple/tall : 1 white/dwarf phenotypic ratio
    we predicted under "Hypothesis 1"

3.  The further apart two genes are, the more **crossing over** can occur
    between them
    -   If far enough apart, we'll see the 9:3:3:1 ratio (they are effectivey
        unlinked)
    -   In between "next to each other" and "far apart" we will see something
        in between the 3:1 and 9:3:3:1 ratios


**Covering the above will allow us to skip Lectures 7 and 8 (extensions to
Mendel) from Bio 180, and go straight to Lecture 9 on human genetic dz.**
