# Our goals

1.  Mendel's solution to Darwin's dilemma

2.  Analyzing monohybrid crosses

## Darwin's dilemma: the problem of variation

Darwin didn't know where variation came from or how it was inherited

-   Selection would exhaust existing variation
-   Blending inheritance would dilute new variants

## Mendel's solution

Mendel was trying to understand the basic patterns of inheritance

Two working hypotheses (what are these?):

1.  Blending inheritance
    -   The genetic material from each parent mixes together---blending to form
        intermediate phenotypes

2.  Inheritance of acquired characters
    -   Phenotypes of individuals change throughout life due to use; the changed
        form is passed on to offspring


Mendel used garden peas as a model organism

-   Studied 7 characteristics, each with 2 distinct phenotypes
-   The 2 phenotypes existed in pure breeding lines
    -   E.g., his tall individuals produced all tall offspring when mated to
        themselves or other tall individuals

Q: Why did Mendel bother to analyze 7 different traits? Why not just one?

-   To test the hypothesis that his results were due to analyzing a weird trait

Q: What was important about using pure lines?

-   Whatever the hereditary "stuff" was, Mendel knew that pure lines had only
    one version

## Mendel's monohybrid cross

### Tall vs dwarf growth habit

-   Mendel's protocol:
    1.  Cross pure-line parentals to yield $F_1$ offspring
    2.  Allow $F_1$s to self-fertilize to produce $F_2$ offspring

-   Mendel's results:
    1.  Phenotypes of $F_1$s: All tall
    2.  Phenotypes of $F_2$s: Some tall, some dwarf

Two HUGE innovations here:

1.  He looked at $F_2$s
2.  He counted (observed ~ 3:1 ratio)

From these results, Mendel claimed:

1.  Blending inheritance was not correct. Which observations support this conclusion?
    -   $F_1$s were all tall (not intermediate)
    -   Some $F_2$s were dwarfed---they didn't blend

2.  Inheritance of acquired characters is not correct. Which observations support this?
    -   Some $F_2$s were dwarfed---couldn't have been acquired, because no
        $F_1$s were dwarfed

-   The other six traits gave similar results. Why was this important?
    -   Evidence that the pattern is general---not limited to height

-   Reciprocal crosses gave the same results. Why was this important?
    -   Evidence that the pattern is general---not specific to the gender of
        the parent

Some terminology (for now):

**Gene**

:   A factor that influences the phenotype for a particular trait, and is
    passed on to offspring

**Allele**:

:   A particular form of a gene


## Mendel's model

1.  Inheritance is particulate---blending doesn't occur
    -   Evidence?
        -   Integrity of dwarf allele (reappears in $F_2$s)

2.  Each individual pea plant has two alleles of each gene
    -   Evidence?
        -   If $F_1$s had only tall alleles, it would not be possible for some
            $F_2$s to be dwarfed

3.  Individuals can be **homozygous** or **heterozygous**
    -   **heterozygous**: Having 2 different alleles of a gene
    -   **homozygous**: Having 2 identical alleles of a gene
    -   Evidence?
        -   \*Introduce genotype notation for peas
        -   The pure lines had only tall (*TT*) or only dwarf (*tt*) alleles;
            $F_1$s had to have one of each (*Tt*)

4.  Some alleles are dominant to others; some alleles are recessive
    -   Dominance and recessiveness are defined **ONLY** in terms of the
        phenotype of heterozygotes
        -   \*Dominance has nothing to do with frequency or fitness!
        -   \*E.g., Huntington's disease alleles
    -   Most alleles are not strictly dominant or recessive (Mendel got a bit
        lucky)
    -   Genotypes and phenotypes are distinct

5.  During gamete formation in a parent, pairs of alleles segregate (separate)
    and go into different gametes (each gamete receives one allele of each
    gene) = **Law of segregation**
    -   What gamete genotypes are produced by parents with the following
        genotypes?
        -   $PP$: $\frac{1}{2}P$ : $\frac{1}{2}P$ (or simply $P$)
        -   $Pp$: $\frac{1}{2}P$ : $\frac{1}{2}p$
        -   $A_1A_2$: $\frac{1}{2}A_1$ : $\frac{1}{2}A_2$
        -   $X^RX^r$: $\frac{1}{2}X^R$ : $\frac{1}{2}X^r$

    -   This is a pattern; what's the process?
    -   **Chromosomal theory of inheritance** explains this law/pattern

6.  Male and female gametes fuse to form a zygote
    -   Each offspring has 2 alleles
    -   One allele from each parent


## Does Mendel's model work? Interpretting a monohybrid cross

-   $TT \,\textrm{\male} \times tt \,\textrm{\female}$ (Crossing tall male with dwarf female)

-   Gamete genotypes: All $T$ for male, all $t$ for female

-   $F_1$ genotypes: All $Tt$

-   **What happens when an $F_1$ offspring self-fertilizes?**

-   Genotypes of $F_1$ cross: $Tt \times Tt$

-   $F_1$ gamete genotypes: $\frac{1}{2}T$ : $\frac{1}{2}t$ for both parents

-   Punnett square:

    --------------  --------------- ---------------
                    $\frac{1}{2}T$  $\frac{1}{2}t$
    --------------  --------------- ---------------
    $\frac{1}{2}T$  $\frac{1}{4}TT$ $\frac{1}{4}Tt$

    $\frac{1}{2}t$  $\frac{1}{4}Tt$ $\frac{1}{4}tt$
    --------------  --------------- ---------------

-   Expected ratio of $F_2$ genotypes: 1$TT$ : 2$Tt$ : 1$tt$
-   Expected ratio of $F_2$ phenotypes: 3 tall : 1 dwarf

-   These predictions match Mendel's results!

## What about 2 traits?

Mendel's question: are the alleles for different alleles transmitted together
or independently?

The experimental dihybrid cross: Purple-flowered tall ($PPTT$) $\times$
white-flowered dwarf ($pptt$)

-   **Hypothesis 1**: Alleles from different genes are transmitted together
    (e.g., $P$ and $P$ segregate, but $P$ and $T$ from one parent stay
    together)

    -   \*\*\*Predict results of $PTPT \times ptpt$ cross if this hypothesis is
        correct

-   **Hypothesis 2**: Alleles from different genes are transmitted
    independently

    -   \*\*\*Predict results of $PPTT \times pptt$ cross if this hypothesis is
        correct

### Mendel's results

-   $YYRR \times yyrr$
    -   $Y$ = yellow seeds, $y$ = green seeds
    -   $R$ = round seeds, $r$ = wrinkled seeds
-   All $F_1$s were yellow and round

-   Phenotypes of $F_2$ ofspring were:

    --------------- ---
    yellow-round    315
    green-round     108
    yellow-wrinkled 101
    green-wrinkled  32
    total           556
    --------------- ---

What hypothesis do these observations support?

Other combinations of two traits produced similar results

Mendel's conclusion: The alleles of each gene are segregating independently of
each other = the **law of independent assortment**

-   NOTE: this is a "sometimes law" (cookie monster)

To understand the processes that explain Mendel's laws, we need to examine two
types of cell division that were first described in the late 1800s---mitosis
and meiosis

But first, what are chromosomes ("colored bodies")?
