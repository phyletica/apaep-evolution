# Darwin's theory of evol by natural selection

##  Pattern:
-   **Evolution**: the characteristics of populations change over time
-   **Common ancestry**: all species have descended from a common ancestor

-   How different from Lamarck?
    -   \*\*\* slide
    -   Lamarck:
        -   All species are independent
            -   E.g., Every species of mammal independently evolved hair, every
                species of vertebrate independently evolved vertebra
        -   Change is progressive
    -   Darwin:
        -   All species are related, inherited shared traits from common
            ancestor
            -   Vertebrae and hair only need ot evolve once
        -   Change is NOT progressive

-   Not a new idea, but Darwin did a great job of compiling evidence

### Evidence for the pattern (change and common ancestry)

**Prediction: Earth is old**

-   1st line of evidence:
    -   Sedimentary and volcanic rocks form in layers
    -   Based on the rates of sedimentation, it took vast amounts of time to form
        the layers of rock we see
    -   Deeper layers should be older; supported by fossils found
-   2nd line of evidence:
    -   Radiometric dating (based on rates of radioactive decay)
    -   Earth is ~4.6 billion years old
    -   First signs of life appear in rocks ~3.8 billion years old
    -   Confirms that deeper layers are older
-   Two independent lines of evidence corroborate each other; this is what we
    always try for in science

**Prediction:** Species in past were different

-   Fossils confirm
-   99% of species now extinct

**Prediction:** Traits are shared due to inheritance from a common ancestor:
**homology**

-   We know varieties of domesticated animals all share the same organs,
    muscles, bones, and genes due to ancestry
-   \*\*\*Dogs from gray wolves
-   Probably true for wild species too

**Prediction:** We should find remnants of lost traits

-   **Vestigial trait**: A reduced structure that has no function, but
    resembles a functional structure in a related species
-   Lots of examples:
    -   Some whales and snakes have hip and leg bones
    -   Caecilians (burrowing amphibians) have eyes beneath their skull
    -   flightless birds have wings
    -   Our tail bone (coccyx)
    -   Goose bumps
    -   \*\*\*Embryonic tail
    -   Embryonic gill pouch
    -   \*\*\*Rarely, the tail is not broken down by immune cells
    -   Gene to make Vitamin C

**Prediction:** If different species we see today shared a common
ancestor, we should find fossils with "transitional" traits

-   Case study: Origins of the tetrapods
-   Challenges to transition from water to land
    -   Gravity: Skeleton and musculature must support and move body mass
    -   Feeding: Cannot suction feed on land
    -   Must prevent desiccation
    -   Breathing: Gill filaments collapse due to gravity

-   In late Devonian (385-360mya), we see several fossil species exhibiting
    adaptations to overcome these challenges

-   *Eusthenopteron*
    -   Large (1.8m)
    -   Fully aquatic; inhabited shallow marine waters
    -   Pectoral fin contained bones homologous to humerus, radius, ulna
    -   Pelvic fin contained bones homologous to femur, tibia, fibula

-   *Panderichthyes*
    -   "walked" along bottom of shallow water
    -   Dorso-ventrally flattened
    -   lacked dorsal and anal fins
    -   reduced tail fin
    -   more robust pectoral girdle
    -   eyes located dorsally
    -   middle-ear modifications similar to tetrapods

-   *Tiktaalik*
    -   Shallow water
    -   Lacks operculum (bony sheath that covers gills) -> allows flexible neck
    -   Pectoral and pelvic girdles much more robust
    -   Could probably prop itself up on fins for forays onto land
    -   Found on Ellesmere Island, Canada (was near equator 375mya) in 2004
        -   Predicted they would find transitional fossil there based on age of
            rock and habitat
        -   Found 3 fossilized skeletons!

-   *Acanthostega*
    -   Well-developed pectoral and pelvic girdles and distinct neck
    -   Eight bony digits on forelimb and hindlimb
    -   Primarily aquatic, but able to walk on land

-   *Ichthyostega*
    -   Well-developed pectoral and pelvic girdles and distinct neck
    -   Seven bony digits and hindlimb
    -   Bendable elbow
    -   Vertebral column reinforced by strong connections between vertebrae
    -   Ribs expanded into distinct rib cage
    -   Probably had lungs and gills

-   Summary:
-   In Late Devonian, we see the diversification of a clade of shallow-water
    adapted fish
-   During the evolution of these species we see the appearance of many
    adaptations for living in shallow-water habitats and land
-   These adaptations subsequently allowed tetrapods to invade and diversify on
    land


##  Process?? \*\*\*Darwin's quote

This was Darwin's big insight (but not only person!!)

Darwin's process (natural selection) had 4 postulates:

1.  Traits differ among individuals in a population

2.  Some of these trait differences are passed onto offspring (heritable)

3.  Not all individuals produce the same number of offspring

4.  Individuals with certain heritable traits produce more offspring

Darwin was verbose, we can distill this down:

Natural selection occurs when **heritable variation** leads to **differential
reproductive success**

How is this process different from Lamarck's?

-   It's a process of **sorting** individuals, not **transforming** them
-   Sorting pre-existing variation/differences

-   Giraffe example:
    -   Individual giraffes didn't stretch their necks
    -   Taller giraffes just had more babies on average

-   *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* example:
    -   Individual bacteria did not become resistant to antibiotic
    -   The ones with an odd shaped enzyme (RNA polymerase) could
        replicate when the antibiotic was present


**KEY POINTS**:

-   Evolution is simply an outcome (the pattern) of this process!
-   Selection is acting on individuals, but populations evolve
-   Context (**Environment**) is important!
    -   It means nothing to say that *M. tuberculosis* with an odd shaped RNA
        polymerase have greater repro success


Is "survival of the fittest" a good description?
-   **Emphasize**: The focus should be on reproduction, not survival!


## Some useful terminology

-   **phenotype**: A detectable trait of an individual
-   **fitness**: The reproductive success of an individual, relative to others
-   **adaptation**: A heritable trait (phenotype) that increases the fitness of
    an individual in a particular **environment**


## Following publication of *Origin of Species*
-   Evolution (the pattern) was accepted by most scientists by the 1870s--1880s
-   But the mechanism of natural selection was controversial until 1930s
-   Problems:
    1.  Selection will run out of variation; Why?
    -   Once every individual in the population has the "good" trait; then
        what? No more variation -> no more evolution
    2.  \*\*\* **Blending inheritance** was the working theory at the time; Why
        is this a problem?
        -   New advantageous forms of a trait would blend with the common forms of the trait 

-   The problem was that Darwin didn't know where variation came from or how it
    was inherited
-   Darwin died thinking that his theory was in trouble
-   Part of the solution had been published years before in 1865---next week!
