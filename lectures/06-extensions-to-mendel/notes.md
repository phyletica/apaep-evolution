# Extensions to Mendel


## Sex linkage

Thomas Hunt Morgan started working with fruit flies in early 1900s.

He was skeptical of Darwinism, Mendel's work, and the chromosomal theory of
inheritance.

-   He was trying to disprove them

In 1910, \*\*\* he discovered a male fly with white eyes (normally have red eyes)

-   He proposed the white eyes resulted from a mutation
-   Started performing crosses to figure out inheritance

**Cross 1**: Red-eyed \female $\times$ white-eyed \male

-   All $F_1$s have red eyes

**Cross 2**: Let $F_1$ males and females breed

-   In $F_2$s, 3 red-eyed : 1 white-eyed

    -   \*What hypothesis would explain these data?
        
        *Eye color controlled by 1 gene with 2 alleles. Red-eyed allele is
        dominant, white-eyed is recessive, and the alleles of the eye-color
        gene segregate during meiosis*

-   **BUT**, all the white-eyed $F_2$ progeny are male!


Is there an association between gender and inheritance of eye color in fruit
flies?

**Cross 3**: $F_1$ red-eyed \female $\times$ white-eyed \male

-   Some of the $F_2$ females have white eyes

-   \*What is the significance of this result?

    *Females can inherit white eyes (not exclusive to males)*


**Cross 4**: White-eyed \female $\times$ true-breeding red-eyed \male

-   All females have red eyes; all males have white eyes

-   This is reciprocal of **Cross 1**; same results? NO!

What is going on?!?


Nettie Stevens had just (1905) discovered sex chromosomes in grasshoppers

-   XY = \male; XX = \female

-   Could the eye color allele be on the X chromosome?

-   Let's find out!

    -   $X^E$ = red-eyed allele
    -   $X^e$ = white-eyed allele

    -   \*Why do we think it's on X?

        -   Females can have white-eyes (**Cross 3**)

    -   \*Why do we think white is recessive?

        -   All $F_1$s had red-eyes in **Cross 1**


### Cross 1: Red-eyed female X white-eyed male

\*What are the parental genotypes? Why?

Parental genotypes: $X^EX^E \times X^eY$

Gamete genotypes of parents: All $X^E$ for female; $\frac{1}{2}X^e and \frac{1}{2}Y for male$

Punnett square:

-----------------  --------------------
                   $X^E$
-----------------  --------------------
$\frac{1}{2}X^e$   $\frac{1}{2}X^EX^e$ 

$\frac{1}{2}Y$     $\frac{1}{2}X^EY$
-----------------  --------------------

Offspring genotypes: $\frac{1}{2}X^EX^e$ : $\frac{1}{2}X^EY$

Offspring phenotypes: $\frac{1}{2}$ red-eyed females : $\frac{1}{2}$ red-eyed males

**NOTE**: when analyzing sex-linked crosses, we report male and female
phenotypes separately


### Cross 2: $F_1$ females X $F_1$ males

Parental genoypes: $X^EX^e  \times X^EY$

Gametes produced: $\frac{1}{2}X^E$ and $\frac{1}{2}X^e$ for \female; $\frac{1}{2}X^E$ and $\frac{1}{2}Y$ for \male

Punnett square:

-----------------  --------------------  --------------------
                   $\frac{1}{2}X^E$      $\frac{1}{2}X^e$
-----------------  --------------------  --------------------
$\frac{1}{2}X^E$   $\frac{1}{4}X^EX^E$   $\frac{1}{4}X^EX^e$

$\frac{1}{2}Y$     $\frac{1}{4}X^EY$     $\frac{1}{4}X^eY$
-----------------  --------------------  --------------------

Offspring genotypes: $\frac{1}{4}X^EX^E$ : $\frac{1}{4}X^EX^e$ : $\frac{1}{4}X^EY$ : $\frac{1}{4}X^eY$

Offspring phenotypes $\frac{2}{4}$ red-eyed females : $\frac{1}{4}$ red-eyed males : $\frac{1}{4}$ white-eyed males

\*We see 3 red : 1 white, and all white-eyed are male!!


### Cross 3: $F_1$ females X white-eyed males

Parental genotypes: $X^EX^e  \times X^eY$

Gametes produced: $\frac{1}{2}X^E$ and $\frac{1}{2}X^e$ for \female; $\frac{1}{2}X^e$ and $\frac{1}{2}Y$ for \male

Punnett square:

-----------------  --------------------  --------------------
                   $\frac{1}{2}X^E$      $\frac{1}{2}X^e$
-----------------  --------------------  --------------------
$\frac{1}{2}X^e$   $\frac{1}{4}X^EX^e$   $\frac{1}{4}X^eX^e$

$\frac{1}{2}Y$     $\frac{1}{4}X^EY$     $\frac{1}{4}X^eY$
-----------------  --------------------  --------------------

Offspring genotypes: $\frac{1}{4}X^EX^e$ : $\frac{1}{4}X^eX^e$ : $\frac{1}{4}X^EY$ : $\frac{1}{4}X^eY$

Offspring phenotypes $\frac{1}{4}$ red-eyed females : $\frac{1}{4}$ white-eyed females : $\frac{1}{4}$ red-eyed males : $\frac{1}{4}$ white-eyed males

\*Females with white eyes!


### Cross 4: white-eyed females X red-eyed males
Parental genotypes: $X^eX^e \textrm{female} \times X^EY$

Gamete genotypes of parents: All $X^e$ for female; $\frac{1}{2}X^E and \frac{1}{2}Y for male$

Punnett square:

-----------------  --------------------
                   $X^e$
-----------------  --------------------
$\frac{1}{2}X^E$   $\frac{1}{2}X^EX^e$ 

$\frac{1}{2}Y$     $\frac{1}{2}X^eY$
-----------------  --------------------

Offspring genotypes: $\frac{1}{2}X^EX^e$ : $\frac{1}{2}X^eY$

Offspring phenotypes: $\frac{1}{2}$ red-eyed females : $\frac{1}{2}$ white-eyed males

\*Matches the data!

### Red-green color blindness in humans

Human vision:

-   We have three kinds of cone cells in our retina, each with a different pigment

-   \*\*\*Each pigment absorb different ranges of wavelengths; peak sensitivities:
    -   Medium-long (yellow-green)
        -   Often referred to as long / red
    -   Medium (green)   
    -   Short (blue)

-   Absorption spectra overlap; cover the visible spectrum
-   Absorbing light activates cone cell, sending signal to brain

Red-green color blindness caused by "defective" allele of the gene that codes
for red or green retinal photoreceptors (cones)

The "defective" alleles are recessive (only need one "good" copy)

Both genes are on the X-chromosome


## What happens if 2 genes are on same chromosome?

### Linked genes and recombination

Morgan's lab found another gene on the X chromosome of fruit flies:

-   $X^B$ = normal (gray) body color
-   $X^b$ = yellow body color

\*Let's predict what will happen!

Parental genotypes: $X^{eB}X^{eB} \times X^{Eb}Y$

-   \* **Cross to get $F_1$s, then cross $F_1$s to get $F_2$s**
-   \* **What are the genotypes and phenotypes of $F_2$ MALE offspring?**

Gamete genotypes: all $X^{eB}$ for \female; $\frac{1}{2}X^{Eb}$ and $\frac{1}{2}Y$ for \male

Punnett square:

--------------------   --------------------------
                       $X^{eB}$
--------------------   --------------------------
$\frac{1}{2}X^{Eb}$    $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}X^{Eb}$ 

$\frac{1}{2}Y$         $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}Y$
--------------------   --------------------------

$F_1$ genotypes: $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}X^{Eb}$ : $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}Y$

$F_1$ cross: $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}X^{Eb} \times \frac{1}{2}X^{eB}Y$

$F_1$ gametes: $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}$ and $\frac{1}{2}X^{Eb}$ for female; $\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}$ and $\frac{1}{2}Y$ for male

Punnett square:

--------------------   --------------------------   ---------------------------
                       $X^{eB}$                     $X^{Eb}$
--------------------   --------------------------   ---------------------------
$\frac{1}{2}X^{eB}$    $\frac{1}{4}X^{eB}X^{eB}$    $\frac{1}{4}X^{Eb}X^{eB}$

$\frac{1}{2}Y$         $\frac{1}{4}X^{eB}Y$         $\frac{1}{4}X^{Eb}Y$
--------------------   --------------------------   ---------------------------

Expected $F_2$ females: $\frac{1}{2}$ white-eyed, normal body : $\frac{1}{2}$ red-eyed, normal body

Expected $F_2$ males: $\frac{1}{2}$ white-eyed, normal body : $\frac{1}{2}$ red-eyed, yellow body

Morgan's results:


------------------------    -------
Phenotype                   Number
------------------------    -------
White eyes, normal body     4292

Red eyes, yellow body       4605

White eyes, yellow body     86

Red eyes, normal body       44
------------------------    -------

What are the genotypes of the unexpected males?

-   $X^{eb}Y$ = white eyes, yellow body
-   $X^{EB}Y$ = red eyes, normal body


This is called **recombination** (**recombinants**); Where the heck did they come from?

-   **Crossing over** is the physical mechanism for genetic recombination

    -   Synapsed homologs swap segments of their chromosomes during meiosis

Can use the percentage of recombinant genotypes to map where genes are on
chromosomes

-   Units for distance between genes called centiMorgans in Thomas Hunt Morgans
    honor

T.H. Morgan set out to disprove Mendel's laws and the chromosomal theory of
inheritance

He ended up providing more evidence for it (he was convinced)

\*\*\* Q: Several of Mendel's traits are linked. Why did they sort
independently?


## Are alleles always dominant or recessive?

### Codominance

When heterozygotes express both phenotypes seen in the two different
homozygotes

ABO blood types in humans:

-------------   -----------------------------------
$I^A$ allele    Glycoprotein A on red blood cells

$I^B$ allele    Glycoprotein B on red blood cells

$i$ allele      no gene product on red blood cells
-------------   -----------------------------------


--------------------    ---------------
Genotype                Phenotype
--------------------    ---------------
$I^AI^A$ and $I^Ai$     A blood type

$I^BI^B$ and $I^Bi$     B blood type

$I^AI^B$                AB blood type

$ii$                    O blood type
--------------------    ---------------


What are the dominance relationships between $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$?

Physical mechanism?

-   \*\*\*Both alleles are producing a product
-   Common at the molecular level


### Incomplete dominance
When heterozygotes have a phenotype that is in between (intermediate to) the
two different homozygotes

\*\*\* Great examples include 4-o'clock and snapdragon flowers

Physical mechanism?

-   Often dosage (concentration)

-   Only one of the alleles is forming a product, but lower concentration in
    heterozygotes

## Is there always a one-to-one mapping of gene to trait?


### Pleiotropy
When a gene influences multiple traits (many genes; common)

Example: Marfan syndrome 

-   Caused by mutation (dominant allele) of $FBN1$ gene
-   $FBN1$ gene encodes fibrilin (glycoprotein component of the extracellular
    matrix), which is important in connective tissue
-   Phenotypes:
    -   Tall
    -   Thin
    -   Long arms, fingers and toes
    -   Abnormally shaped chest
    -   Flexible joints
    -   Scoliosis
    -   Heart problems


### Polygenic
When multiple genes influence the same trait

Very common; example: human height

## Gene x gene interactions


Epistasis

:   When affect of allele at one gene depends on alleles at other genes

### E.g., Alzheimer's Disease risk

Apolipoprotein E (APOE)---transports cholesterol to the brain

One allele (E4) is associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's Disease

But, whether Alzheimer's develops seems to depend on the alleles present at 3
other genees (at least)

E4 also associated with higher levels of Vitamin D (pleiotropy too!)


## Gene x environment interactions

### Case 1

Inuit residents of Barrow, Alaska, where people over 35 had not attended
American-stule schools

------- ----------------------------------
Age     % diagnosed myopic (sample size)
------- ----------------------------------
6--35   42 (348)

36--88  5 (150)
------- ----------------------------------

What can explain these data?

-   Genetic background has not changed, but environment did
-   Reading books in American-style schools induced myopia



\*\*\* (Case 2) Data on Pima people from Mexico versus USA

-   The Pima are a group of Native Americans from what is now Arizona

-   Interpret these graphs; what do thay mean?

-   Similar genetics leading to very different phenotypes in different
    environments (diet and rates of physical activity)
