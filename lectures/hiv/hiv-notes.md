# Summary of HIV treatments

## 1998 Berlin patient (anonymous)

-   Was prescribed an unusual combination of drugs:
    -   didanosine, indinavir, and hydroxyurea

-   Hydroxyurea was unusual: is a cancer drug

-   This combination was part of a small trial

-   Virus remained undetectable after stopping anti-retroviral drugs

-   Only one in the trial; could be chance, genetics, environment, etc.

## 2008 Berlin patient (Timothy Ray Brown)

-   Diagnosed with HIV in 1995 and began anti-retroviral drugs
-   Diagnosed with leukemia in 2006
-   Had two hematopoietic stem cell transplant (2007 and 2008)
-   Donor had "delta 32" mutation on the CCR5 receptor
-   Most HIV cannot enter cell without a functional CCR5 protein
    -   Individuals homozygous for this mutation rarely progress to AIDs
    -   There are exceptions that use other protein receptors

-   He remains off ARV drugs and is considered cured
    -   Unclear whether he has traces of virus in some of his cells (could be
        "functionally" cured)

### Was cure caused by CCR5 alleles?

-   He suffered from graft-versus-host disease
-   Six people seem to have been freed of HIV after getting graft-vs-host
    disease, and only one of them had CCR5 mutatn stem cells

-   These transplants are dangerous and graft-vs-host disease is often fatal

-   moratorium on these

### Monkeys as model for bone marrow transplants

-   5 macaques left on an Mauritius lsland in Indian Ocean by Dutch spice
    traders 500 years ago, only 1 was female.

-   Very little genetic diversity, so much easier to find good matches for bone
    marrow transplants

-   Probably a long ways off from being safe in humans
    -   It might be a while before we know if and how it works to cure HIV

## Mississippi Baby

-   Born with HIV in 2010
-   Received anti-retroviral drugs 30 hours after birth
-   HIV was undetectable in 2013
-   But infection detected in 2014

## Treatment with anti-retroviral (ART) drugs

-   We now have many ART drugs grouped into 6 classes
-   Regimens of 3 ARTs from 2--3 classes

# Promising treatments

##  The use of anti-bodies is promising

##  Several vaccines being worked on

### RIVER trials

-   Use combination of 2 vaccines to "train" immune system to attack HIV
    infected cells
-   Then, stimulate dormant HIV-infected cells with vorinostat so that
    immune system can purge infection
-   One man from UK apparently cured in 2016
-   Trials ongoing
