Mendel documented the basic patterns of inheritance

-   His model predicts those patterns, but what is the physical mechanism
    (process)?

-   To understand the processes that explain Mendel's laws, we need to examine
    two types of cell division that were first described in the late
    1800s---mitosis and meiosis

-   But first, what are chromosomes ("colored bodies")?

# What is a chromosome?

Scientists in late 1800s documented long "strings" in the nucleus of cells
that moved around during cell division

They visualized them using stains -> "colored bodies"

In 1900, scientists rediscovered Mendel's work from 1860s and realized that the
pattern of movement during formation of sex cells could explain inheritance

Proposed that genes are on the chromosomes!

We now know that chromosomes are long molecules of DNA and associated proteins


Chromosomes come in different types, distinguished by size and shape (morphology)

-   Draw 5

    -   \*Draw 5 different types of lines

In many organisms there are 2 of each type of chromosome present

-   Draw the second of each type

    -   \* Add a matching line to each of the 5, making a total of 10

Pairs of each type are said to be homologous (they are homologs)

-   Circle the 5 pairs of homologs

Terms:

Ploidy

:   The number of each type of chromosome present (how many homologs)

    haploid = 1 of each

    diploid = 2 of each

    triploid = 3 of each

Haploid number

:   The number of different types of chromosomes present

Sister chromatid

:   Identical copies of a chromosome that are physically connected

    Formed when the chromosomes are replicated

    Still one chromosome

Homologs

:   Separate chromosomes that came from different parents (can have different
    genetic info; diff alleles)


\*\*\*Q: What is the haploid number and ploidy of this cell?


Draw the unreplicated chromosomes of a diploid cell in a species with a haploid
number = 5 (n = 5, 2n = 10)

Draw the replicated chromosomes of a diploid cell in a species with a haploid
number = 3 (n = 3, 2n = 6)


\*\*\*Q: Prior to DNA replication...


# Mitosis

Mitosis

:   The process responsible for asexual reproduction and growth in multicellular organisms

Draw unreplicated chromosomes of a diploid cell with a total of 4 chromosomes

Chromosomes replicate

Chromosomes line up

Sister chromatids separate

Cell divides

-   What is the ploidy of the daughter cells?

-   What is the haploid number of the daughter cells?

-   Is this the same or different than the parent cell?


# Meiosis

Meiosis

:   The process responsible for sexual reproduction in multicellular organisms


How does it happen?

NOTE: Meiosis consists of 2 cell divisions

## Meiosis I

Draw unreplicated chromosomes of a diploid cell with a total of 4 chromosomes

Chromosomes replicate

Homologs synapse

Homologous pairs line up

Homologs pull apart

Cell divides

-   What is the ploidy of the daughter cells?

-   What is the haploid number of the daughter cells?

-   Is this the same or different than the parent cell?

    -   Ploidy is halved!


## Meiosis II (same in both daughter cells)

Chromosomes line up

Sister chromatids pull apart

Cell divides

-   What is the ploidy of the daughter cells?

-   What is the haploid number of the daughter cells?

-   Is this the same or different than the parent cell?

    -   Same as mitosis!

What is the physical mechanism responsible for the law of segregation?

-   Homologs pulling apart in Meiosis I

What is the physical mechanism responsible for the law of independent assortment?

-   Joined homologs lining up in center of of cell during Meiosis I
-   They line up independently of one another


# Putting it all together: the chromosome theory of inheritance

Pattern

:   Mendel's laws. The alleles of the same gene separate, and alleles of
    different genes separate independently

Process

:   Genes are on chromosomes that undergo meiosis

## Proposition 1:
The law of segregation results from the separation of homologous chromosomes at
meiosis I

\*Draw this for an individual with genotype $Pp$

## Proposition 2:
The law of independent assortment occurs because maternal and paternal homologs
of different chromosomes line up independently of one another during meiosis I

\*Draw this for an individual with genotype $PpTt$ (2 pairs of homologs)


We have solved part of Darwin's dilemma

-   We now know how inheritance works; alleles (versions of genes) are passed
    to offspring on chromosomes
-   Alleles don't blend


But, we still don't know where variation (different alleles) come from

-   Before we cover that, let's first cover some extensions to Mendel's model
