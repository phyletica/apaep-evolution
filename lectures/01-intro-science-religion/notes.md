# Science-religion conflict?

## What is Science?
-   An open-ended endeavor to come up with ever-improving testable explanations
    for patterns we see in nature
    -   Using evidence to figure out **how** nature works
-   **Hypothesis**: A testable explanation of a set of observations (a pattern
    in nature)
-   **Theory**: A testable explanation for a broad class of phenomena/patterns
    that is supported by a lot of evidence
    -   Serves as a framework for developing new hypotheses
    -   Have 2 components:
        #.  A pattern component
            -   What we observe
            -   Facts about the natural world
            -   the **WHAT**

        #.  A process component
            -   The mechanism responsible for the pattern;
            -   The **HOW**
-   Science deals with questions that can be answered by going out and
    measuring something

## What is religion?
-   **Religion**: A system of beliefs held to with faith (Merriam-Webster
    Dictionary)
-   **Faith**: Firm belief in something for which there is no proof
-   By definition, belief and faith do not depend on evidence
-   Religion deals with questions that cannot be answered with evidence

## There is no conflict
-   Science and religion are fundamentally different
    -   One is not better or worse than the other
-   Science uses evidence to figure out **how** things work
-   Religion is based on beliefs about **why** things are   
-   Science is completely confined to the natural world
-   Religion is about supernatural beliefs
-   Vast majority of the scientists who have ever lived are religious
    (including evolutionary biologists)
-   In this class, we will explore natural, testable explanations for the
    diversity of life on our planet (evidence/patterns)
    -   Please do not interpret that as an insult
