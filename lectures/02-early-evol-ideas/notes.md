# What is Science?

-   Coming up with testable explanations for patterns we see in nature
-   Using evidence to figure out **how** nature works
-   Open-ended, always testing and refining explanations
<!--
-   An open-ended endeavor to come up with ever-improving testable explanations
    for patterns we see in nature
-->
-   Science starts with a question about a pattern
    -   How come there are so many types of organisms on our planet?
    -   How did they become so well adapted to their environment?
-   **Hypothesis**: An explanation of a set of observations (a pattern
    in nature)
    -   It must make testable predictions
    -   We test those predictions via observation and/or experiments
    -   Goal is to find patterns inconsistent with prediction

-   **Theory**: An explanation for a broad class of phenomena/patterns that is
    supported by a lot of evidence
    -   Serves as a framework for developing new hypotheses
    -   Have 2 components:
        #.  A pattern component
            -   What we observe
            -   Facts about the natural world
            -   the **WHAT**

        #.  A process component
            -   The mechanism responsible for the pattern;
            -   The **HOW**

-   We gain confidence in hypothesis or theory as it withstands tests
-   But can never prove with certainty

-   \*Feynman and Einstein quotes


# What is evolution?

-   The change in the characteristics of a population of organisms through time
    (over generations)

-   Is this a pattern or process?

-   Often credited to C.\ Darwin (misconception)

## Early evolutionary ideas

-   Ideas of Plato and Aristotle (~ 350 BCE) dominated for a long time
    -   All species created in their perfect, unchanging form by a deity as a
        link in a chain from simple to complex
    -   *Scala naturae* (great chain of being)

-   Middle ages stifled science in Europe, but not in the Arabic world


### Al-Jahiz (781--868)
-   born in Basra, Ethiopian descent

### Buffon (1707-1788)

### Burnett (1714--1799)

### Erasmus Darwin (1731--1802)
-   Charles' grandfather
-   Wrote about shared ancestry of organisms

### Lamarck (1744--1829)

-   Proposes first mechanism (explanation) for evolution

-   Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics
    -   An organism's efforts during its lifetime causes changes to its traits,
        and these changes are passed to its offspring
    -   Pattern: Key claim is that evolution is progressive; leads to chain of life
    -   Process: Key claim is that individuals change in response to their
        environment and pass these changes to offspring

### What was Chucky D's contribution
-   Came up with first mechanism for evolution called natural selection
-   Not the only mechanism
-   Not the only one who thought of it

### Alfred Russell Wallace
