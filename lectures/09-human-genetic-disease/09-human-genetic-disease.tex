        \item Why have eugenics programs in humans been unsuccessful? 
        \begin{clickeroptions}
            \item \clickeranswer{These programs remove variation from the
                    population, and thus decrease the ability of the population
                    to respond to selection pressures.}
            \item \clickeranswer{More closely related individuals are more
                    likely to carry the same deleterious recessive alleles, and
                    thus their offspring are more likely to express genetic
                    disease caused by such alleles.}
            \item \clickeranswer{The environment (and selection pressures) is
                    always changing, and so there are no traits that will be
                    universally ``better'' than others.}

                    environmentally determined traits.}

\section{Selection dynamics of cystic fibrosis alleles}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{description}
        \item[Observation 1:]
            Alleles that cause cystic fibrosis (CF) are at a frequency of about
            2\% in populations of Northern European ancestry.
            Given the strength of selection against individuals with the
            disease phenotype, this is very high, even though the disease
            alleles are recessive.
        \item[Observation 2:]
            \emph{Salmonella typhi}, the bacteria that causes typhoid fever,
            enters gut cells through the normal CF gene product (CFTR protein).
            This event starts an infection.

    In terms of fitness, are human populations in the industrialized countries

    \nbox{I would argue ``no'', because (1) fitness is only meaningful
        within the context of the current environment, (2) having more
        variation in the population makes it more adaptable (more variation to
        respond to changing selection pressures).}
